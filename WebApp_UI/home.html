<div class="context-body">
    Welcome to the nanking restaurant to experience the
    hospitality of this ancient city of China ! Nanking is a city
    about equal distance from Canton and Peking.In 1842,
    after nanking was captured by the British, Sir Henry pottinger signed the nanking treaty. What followed
    thereafter was an era where various eating places opened
    up for visitors to enjoy the hospitality of this region. The food was modified to suit the palette of the
    visitors to entice them to come back to these eating places. This
    fusion cuisine became very popular. It is our humble endeavor at nanking Restaurant to bring you the same
    historical
    fusion taste, and hospitality from ancient China. We extend a very warm welcome to you and will make every
    effort
    to make your visit enjoyable and memorable.</div>
